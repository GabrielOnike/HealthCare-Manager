# HealthCare-Manager
Healthcare and Hospital Administration and Management System - Transco and Coin Group Copyright 2021
Currently the Desktop application is being developed using ElectronJS for the shell, MaterialUI-React for the frontEnd.
The project files here is stable and set to run after cloning though only the shell and UI implementation is available.
Other features will keep being added.
See the Master branch for the current version. 
Please *note* that this repo is still in Developer mode and is not bundled for Production. As such, development can start 
after cloning. Follow the main readme for installation of the shell.

Mobile application for client side management is also being developed using Flutter and is stored as a separate but linked project.

Developers are welcome to hop on this project. 
The aspiration of this project is to provide the defacto ever evolving digital platform that offers the best experience in healthcare 
management via existing and emerging digital channels.

Electron version: 11.2.1

To launch, 
- clone the Master
- open your the IDE and navigate to the projects root folder in your Terminal
- use the `npm start` command to launch
- If you see any error, use the OK button to move ahead with App launch
- make sure you have Node installed before launch.


<!--- At some point, this project or parts of it will be monetized. ---> Currently, it is open sourced and healthcare enthusiast developers who
may wish to contribute, build or be a part of this journey are welcome on board. The project scope is large and various 
parts require wide skills.
There is 
- electronJS for the shell management- its less of a language and more of adapting to its style and methods to tap into 
native functionalities.
- ReactJS and Typescript handles the frontend so that's for frontend contributors- theres alot of MaterialUI so for those that love that
library. Bootstrap is used but on when really necessary. State management is being integrated with Redux currently. This is the most built 
part of this application currently.
- NodeJS for the backend management - yarn & npm. 
- Database is SQL built currently though not yet linked. Backend development can hop on this. If you indicate interest, you'd get access
to the link with the SQL file. This functionality is still barebones and in need of attention. SQL database is hosted on the cloud
and provides access points for the desktop and mobile apps to consume. Data is called with axios. Webhooks are to be integrated for the 
consultation/chat functionality to sync with mobile app.
Auth0 is being heavily considered for integration for nore efficient User management and to reduce backend burden. 
All database calls and sessions storage must be made locally and cached on both the dektop and mobile app to provide much needed
offline functionality.
- Data Science will come in representing statistics for the database on the frontend. ReactJS has represenational libraries for this. R is 
also encouraged here for playing around with the data.

<!--- Official contribution will elicit an invitation to our Jira Managed channel. To see user stories, current issues and the roadmap. --->

<!--- For monetization, profits for R & D will be converted to crypto and shared to the most active contributors on a yearly basis. This will occur
for the first 10 years of the project and subsequently on Administration. An equitable arrangement for the top 10 contributors including bug 
hunting will be created. Random pools will be run for occasional gifts to other contributors. The aim is to encourage contribution. Adherence 
to the language and project structure is strict. These offers are separate from privately engaged contributors. Unadherence to standards is deemed 
unlawful. --->

This project belongs to TransCo Inc. not for profit but as a force for creation. Good intent is welcome. Unlawful adaptation, modification or piration is forbidden. 
<!--- This is currently under the custody and curation of Gabriel Onike. Most active contributor every 7 years holds the custodian title and is entitled to Gatekeeper priviledges --->
